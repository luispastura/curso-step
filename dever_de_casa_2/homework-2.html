 <h1>I can do that!</h1>

 <h2>I'm serious as a heart attack</h2>
 <p>Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to
bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You don't get sick, I do. That's
also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We
swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However
unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just
on opposite ends. </p>
 <h2>I gotta piss</h2>
 <p>You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has
a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for murder. After
the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we
turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only
five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say
it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but
it doesn't hold a candle to man. </p>

 <h2>No, motherfucker</h2>
 <p>Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's
called a pilot. Then they show that show to the people who make shows, and on
the strength of that one show they decide if they're going to make more shows.
Some pilots get picked and become television programs. Some don't, become
nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing. </p>
 <h2>I'm serious as a heart attack</h2>
 <p>Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag
clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it? Do you see a little Asian child
with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter
that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's what you see at a toy
store. And you must think you're in a toy store, because you're here shopping
for an infant named Jeb. </p>

 <h2>Is she dead, yes or no?</h2>
 <p>Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, but
you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period so I don't wanna
kill you, I wanna help you. But I can't give you this case, it don't belong to
me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this morning over this case
to hand it over to your dumb ass. </p>
